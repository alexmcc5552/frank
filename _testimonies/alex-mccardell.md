Not just your love for life, but your affection to life - all its pains, all its glories - was impressive. You lived life to the fullest it seems to me - always on the cutting edge of what's next. You wouldn’t have it any other way. I always remember you caring so much about… about everything really.

That’s what made you bigger than life. A spirit for living that shall continue to live on.

Thank you for being part of the WS family, and more importantly thank you for your friendship and your good-natured attitude. And your amazing wit and irony and laughter. We miss you tremendously.
