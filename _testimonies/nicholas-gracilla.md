title: I shall carry your spirit forward
---
I only knew Frank online, where we'd chat about product bugs and our thoughts on the direction of the industry. Mostly, though, it was Frank, encouraging me as no one else has ever done — to try things, to write and share my experiences, and to press on.  Towards the end of June, prompted by nothing at all, I sent him a note to say how much I and my team appreciated him, and ciao from Chicago.  

He had a one of a kind spirit, and will be deeply missed.
